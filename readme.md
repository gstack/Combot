## Installation - Windows

1) Download the Release.zip from the latest release in https://github.com/uncled1023/Combot/releases and extract the files to a directory of your choice.<br>
2) Run Combot-Interface.exe

## Installation - Linux

This is currently untested and not supported.  Due to the interface using WPF, Mono is unable to run the current interface on Linux machines.  In the future I may make an interface that does not utilize WPF for those on Linux.
